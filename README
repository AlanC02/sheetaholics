[INSTALLATION]

Below is a list of packages used by SheetGenerator:

  Python 2.5 has been tested okay. Python 2.7 might fail when using PyInstaller.
* wxPython 2.8
  http://wxpython.org/

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab/2.5

After installing packages above, git clone this project.

# python DottedLined.py

and you will launch the application.



[BUILDING WIN32 EXECUTABLE]

Building win32 executables on Windows 7 with Python 2.5 and PyInstaller 1.4 has been tested.

Download and install Python Win32 Extensions and PyInstaller 1.4 first:

* Python Win32 Extensions
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
  Build 216 has been tested okay.
* PyInstaller 1.4
  http://www.pyinstaller.org/

Change directory to under sheetgenerator/dottedlined/, and execute:
# python path/to/pyinstaller-1.4/Configure.py
# python path/to/pyinstaller-1.4/Makespec.py DottedLined.py --name="DottedLined-win32-1.0" --onefile --windowed
# python path/to/pyinstaller-1.4/Build.py DottedLined-win32-1.0.spec

If fails, try uncommenting line 9~29 (by removing the triple quotes in line 8 and 30) of
sheetgenerator/dottedlined/DottedLined.py and execute the above commands again.

The executable DottedLined-win32-1.0.exe will be generated and located under
